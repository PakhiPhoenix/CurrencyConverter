Note Points:

1. If all JS files are connected with HTML, data can be used from one to another.
2. We can use add and appendChild method to add options in select, add gives the option of selecting the index in list as well.
3. appendChild can be used for many elements like div, p etc.
4. In addEventListener, we can not directly run fn with () as it will run immediately, we can use arrow fn.
